# VisionBased-Dynamic-Traffic-AI
A smart, AI-powered dynamic traffic control system built using Raspberry Pi 5 and a high-resolution camera module. This project intelligently manages traffic lights based on real-time vehicle density and supports green corridors for emergency vehicles (like ambulances), ensuring rapid and safe passage through intersections.
